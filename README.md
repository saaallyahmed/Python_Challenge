# Python-Py Me Up, Charlie



## PyBank

![Revenue](Images/revenue-per-lead.png)

* In this challenge, We created a Python script for analyzing the financial records of the company. We gave a set of financial data called [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv). The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`. (Thankfully, the company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)

* Our team created a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

* As an example, your analysis should look similar to the one below:

  
 ## Financial Analysis
  ----------------------------
  Total Months: 86
  Total: $38382578
  Average  Change: $-2315.12
  Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
  Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)



  ## PyPoll

![Vote Counting](Images/Vote_counting.png)

* In this challenge, Our team were tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.

* We be gave a set of poll data called [election_data.csv](PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv). The dataset was composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`. Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.
